javac is the java compiler part of the JDK or SDK Java development Kit or standard development kit
compiles java files into class files

Java runtime executable (java) runs class files by creating a jvm which is a java virtual machine.
Every run and process has its own jvm and a jvm uses jit (just in time) - to run just the amount of code that is needed ahead of time

is part of the JRE java runtime environment
